# GAS Stack (Github, Google Authentication, Sheets and Scripts)
If you're a front-end developer looking to prototype with logins, databases and APIs: consider some GAS. This light weight (and uh, free(..well, save for the yearly domain payment)) Stack gives you everything you need to build out a fully functional data-driven user account incorporated application. 

Its all driven through your gmail google drive account. 
* DBs: Google sheets 
* API: Lies in sheets as Google's App Scripts.
* Authentication: Create a new app on google developer console and plug in your keys to your front-end code.

### Upgrading?
Ya, so you're in the google cloud system already. The GAS stack can easily be incorporated into google's cloud-based behemoth. Not to mention Ad-sense, tracking, ya know, that kind of stuff.
