# Title: Is it Time for Milk and Cookies?
Christmas Eve is almost upon us, so naturally we need to prepare some milk and cookies for Santa! Create a function that accepts a Date object and returns trueif it's Christmas Eve (December 24th) and false otherwise. Keep in mind JavaScript's Date month is 0 based, meaning December is the 11th month while January is 0.

Examples:
* Date( 2013, 11, 24 ) ➞ true
* Date( 2013, 0, 23 ) ➞ false
* Date( 3000, 11, 24 ) ➞ true
