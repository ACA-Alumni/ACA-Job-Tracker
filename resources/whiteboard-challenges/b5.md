# Title: Find the Smallest and Biggest Numbers
Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum numbers, in that order.

Examples:
* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ➞ [1, 5]
* [2334454, 5] ➞ [5, 2334454]
* [1] ➞ [1, 1]

Notes:
* All test arrays will have at least one element and are valid.
