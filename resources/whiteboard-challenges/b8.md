# Title:  Alphabet Soup
Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.

Examples:
* "hello" ➞ "ehllo"
* "hacker" ➞ "acehkr"
* "geek" ➞ “eegk"

Notes:
* You can assume numbers and punctuation symbols won't be included in test cases. You'll only have to deal with single word, alphabetic characters.
