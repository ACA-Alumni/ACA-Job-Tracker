# Title: Eliminate Odd Numbers within an Array
Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns only the even values.

Examples:
* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] ➞ [2, 4, 6, 8]
* [43, 65, 23, 89, 53, 9, 6] ➞ [6]
* [718, 991, 449, 644, 380, 440] ➞ [718, 644, 380, 440]

Notes:
* Return all even numbers in the order they were given.
* All test cases contain valid numbers ranging from 1 to 3000.
